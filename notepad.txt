The strongest person on this world is that who's seen hardship
The wisest person on this world is that who knows themself

Helped make life festive
People held hands, got united,
Helped us reach for eternity

The maturest person on this world is that who smiles against pain
The noblest person on this world is that who shows mercy
The richest person on this world is that who conquers hearts
The most superior person on this world is that who has love for humanity

If only the whole world believed this, just believed this,
Helped make life festive
People held hands, got united,
Helped us reach for eternity
