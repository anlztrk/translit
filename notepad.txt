Everyone's alone in their own ice castle1
They wish for someone to come and melt the walls down
Everyone's a sailor in this tumultuous ocean
They wish to lower the sails at a cove
 
Everyone's a warrior in their own battle
They wish to lower their guard for somebody
Everyone gets weary of living this life
They wish to lie down by the knees of someone and fall asleep
I'm a stark naked women before you
 
Kept bottling up my pains all along,
Ultimately I ended up by myself
Keep filling, bartender, fill the glass again
Let us see the bottom of this bottle tonight!
 
My pillow still has that warm breath of yours
If only you were with me â€“ how I desire to love!
I feel like messing up it all and going off
If I'm drinking all the time it's for a reason
