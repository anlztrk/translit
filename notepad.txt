Had you asked me, I was ugly, without talent
Wasn't feminine enough either, and I was clumsy
This love of yours for me, it's not a joke, is it?
You've delighted me, have always praised me

You've loved me a lot, you don't regret it, do you?
You've strived for it, are you frendly or hostile?

Was I unique, I wasn't! Plus I was arrogant!
I'd say I'd change but I never did, I was the same me regardless
How did you come to look at me in awe, it's not a joke, is it?
Are we certain that you meant me, that it's me who you adore?
