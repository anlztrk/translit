Make no mistake, I'm not unaware of the rules of the game
It's just that I don't prefer to play by them
I did try, I wasn't pleased
I'll wait until I am

Can pride cause love to die?
Can flowers blossom without rain?
A few words, one final gaze
And you leave my heart for adventures unknown

Make me cry, that's just what fits you after all
It's being human, surely I'll get used to that too
You've caused me so much trouble already
Leave, your departure is in fact my liberation
