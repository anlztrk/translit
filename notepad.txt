Harassment

As soon as I saw her, my heart came to a stop
'She's gotta be mine' I said to myself
I don't know what everyone'd think, but
If I can't obtain her, I swear I would die

I madly try and take what I pick, but
If being nice won't cut it, I swear, it'll be by force

If you won't be mine, I'll harass you
If you don't come to me, I'll eat your life away
I'm quite the stubborn one, of this you're aware,
You're going to be mine, to this I swear
